TASK1:

in this ex, we implemented two classes:

uthreadLibrary - a vec that contains all the uthreads, and also some methods
that gives us info
about the class, in addition we implemented a ready Queue that will save the
 treads that need to
run.
uthread - this class represent a thread, including some fields and methods.
another imortant method is the timehandler, that basiclly this is a clock
that "tells" to us
every quanta.

TASK2:

ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS


1. the main advantage of process is that it faster, but heavier (the memory
that allocated)
and in kernel level it is takes less memory but slower.
probably, google prefer that the browser will be faster than memory save.

2.
   a. - call the ^C(SIGINT)
   b. - call by ^C(SIGINT) signal or "kill <pid>" in the shell or SIGKILL(9)
we saw that "SIGTERM" is the signal that calles when the kill command called.

3.real time is the time that we live with, in the real world(also relative
 "albert einstein")
and the virtual time is the number of quant * time of quants.
 for example when a thread running, it is the virtual time, if hw blocks,
 the real time keeps
 running and the virtual stopps.

4.a. when using fork() command, all the memory that common for the child and
the parant is shared.
b.pipe is a unit betweeen a file that share for changes, for example a file,
 that someone can write
to it and someone can read from it. we dont want that while someone changing
 it someone will read it,
and thats why we will use a pipe.
